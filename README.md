# voiceBrowser

## Voice-Controlled Chrome Browser

This project enables you to control your chrome browser with your voice. Using Python, Hugging Face Sentence-Transformers, Vosk, Selenium, and PyAudio, the application takes in your spoken commands and executes them on a chrome browser. It leverages NLP-driven command recognition to extract and execute user voice commands, using real-time speech-to-text conversion and web automation. More specifically, this project uses a zero-shot-classification trained on the facebook/bart-large-mnli model and paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2.


## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Implemented command recognition and target extraction using Hugging Face's Sentence-Transformers (models: `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- **Zero-Shot Classification:** Utilizes a zero-shot classification model to accurately recognize and execute user commands without predefined categories.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion:** Integrated **Vosk** and **PyAudio** to handle real-time voice commands and convert them to text.
- **Browser Automation:** Uses **Selenium** to automate dynamic web commands, enabling voice-driven control over a Chrome browser.

## Best Way to Operate
It is a tool to control your browser just as your clicks would. You cannot say things such as open Netflix. 
Try using commands like:
- search up how to code or look up how to code
- go back a tab
- go to the next tab
- scroll down a little
- scroll up more
- open a brand new tab
- close this tab
- go back a page
- go to the next page
- click on wikipedia (if your link clink does not work on the first try, say the clickable link part and the small title above the link as well)

For this example, say "click on YouTube apps on Google Play" and "google play".


Keep an eye on the terminal to see when to speak and what the application understood.
